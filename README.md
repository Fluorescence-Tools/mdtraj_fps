# mdtraj-fps
mdtraj-fps tool to calculate FRET observables for MD-trajectories.

mdtraj-fps depends on mdtraj and utilizes the original libraries published together with the "FRET Positioning System" (FPS) in Nature Methods 9, 1218–1225 (2012) "A toolkit and benchmark study for FRET-restrained high-precision structural modeling". 

With mdtraj-fps, you can

- Process every MD format supported by MDTraj
- Calculate FRET efficienes using a fast implicit dye model
- Save calculated positional distributions of dyes for later vizualization
